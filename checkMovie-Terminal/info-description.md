This py-Checkmovie file allows users to check movie information through the terminal, offering an alternative to the Telegram bot designed for similar purposes. Unlike the bot, which requires users to interact through the Telegram messaging platform, this Python script can be executed directly from a user's terminal, providing a more streamlined and potentially automated way to retrieve movie data.
I have made this file available in case someone wants to execute the code via the terminal
